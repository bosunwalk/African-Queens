                The Yoruba history is incomplete without mentioning the brave queen of Oranmiyan, Mọremí Àjàṣorò. She is a prominent woman who is said to have given the Yoruba people a reason to live through her selfless actions towards the Yoruba people’s liberty from the hands of their enemies.
                The Ayaba Moremi, who was born in Offa and lived in the 12th century, was wedded to Oranmiyan, the son of Oduduwa, known as the founder of the Yoruba people and ruler of Ife. According to history, the kingdom of Ile-Ife was at war with a neighbouring tribe known to them as the Forest people, called the “Ugbo Kingdom.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Moremi was a strong, brave, and beautiful woman who, in order to solve the issue that her people were experiencing, made a significant sacrifice to the Spirit of the River Esimirin in order to learn more about the power over her country’s adversaries.<br>
                  She was also renowned as an Ile-Ife native who was both brave and selfless.

                From Nefertiti to cleopatra, Ancient Egypt is known for its powerful women. Living in a world that was dominated by me,
                these Ancient Egyptian women ruled with extraordinary power, strengh, and authority, and shaped history!
                </p>
                <p>
                 One of these women was Hatshepsut, and incredible pharoaoh. She changed Egypt for the better during her reign,
                 which lasted from 1478-1458B.C. In the 18th Dynasty.

                  Queen Amanirenas was the ruler of the kushite kingdom in Africa. She led her armies
                  into battle against the Roman Empire, beginning a five-year war.

                <p>
                 During the war, she lost one eye and became known as one eyed queen. She prevented the
                 roman invasion of her kingdom, which was something none of previous rulers had done before.

                  Two vertical bars of inlaid iron between the eyes allude to medicine-filled incisions that were one source of Idia’s metaphysical power.<br> 
                  Within the court, the queen mother’s political status was equal to that of a senior chief,
                   and she enjoyed the right to commission precious works of art for personal and devotional use.

                  Yaa Asantewaa was an influential Ashanti queen at the beginning of the twentieth century who remains a powerful symbol today. Her birthdate is contested; <br>
                  she is generally believed to be born between the 1840s to 1860s in the Ashanti Confederacy in present-day Ghana.

                <p>
                It is believed that she was chosen for this title
                due to the matrilineal aspect of the Ashanti culture and that her elder brother Nana Akwasi Afrane Okpase, 
                who was a powerful ruler at the time, appointed her to the role.
